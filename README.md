# 🌍 Satellite Data Analysis - Lab 1

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes satellite temperature and humidity data using **Linux commands** and **shell scripting**. The analysis extracts:
- The **top 10 highest temperatures** recorded.
- **Humidity data for Rwanda**, sorted in **descending order**.

The automation is handled using a **Bash script**.

## 📊 Expected Output Files
After running the script, these files will be created inside the `analyzed_data/` folder:

### **`highest_temp.csv` (Top 10 Temperatures)**
### **`humidity_data_Rwanda.csv` (Sorted by Humidity, Highest to Lowest)**
